# HUD Color Override For Custom Peds

This is just a simple .NET script mod that automatically overrides the HUD color of Michael, Franklin or Trevor when you switch to a custom ped, basically any ped that isn't one of the 3 main story protagonists. Switching back to one of the 3 story peds will disable the override. By default the custom hud color is set to blue (the same as in gta online), but it can be changed in the script config file.
